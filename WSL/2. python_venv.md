# Install a python virtual environment (venv) for sanity
1. Python is preinstalled in Ubuntu or any major distro. We need to install `venv` to be able to create a `venv`
```sh
sudo apt install python3-venv
```
2. Create a `venv` in folder `.venv` in the `$HOME` directory.
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```
This will create a hidden folder with the virtual environment installed.
3. Now installed tkinter.
```sh
sudo apt install python3-tk
```
4. Activate the `venv`.
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```
This add `(.venv)` to the start of the next line and all following lines.
5. Now install whatever you want. Here is an example
```sh
pip install numpy
```
