# Install mysql on WSL
1. mysql need systemd init system which was created by [Lennart Poettering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering), when was working in RedHat. [Microsoft's docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/systemd#how-to-enable-systemd) tells you how to add systemd support to WSL2.

Open `wsl.conf` or create a new one.
```sh
sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
```

Add these lines to the file.
```
[boot]
systemd=true
```

Then press CTRL + O and press enter to save. Then press CTRL + X to exit nano.

2. Close all WSL/ Ubuntu window and open a new CMD/MS DOS and type this.

```sh
wsl.exe --shutdown
```

or 
```sh
wsl --shutdown
```

3. Let us update the system again.
```sh
sudo apt update
```

Then install `mysql-server`.
```sh
sudo apt install mysql-server
```
Check if mysql is installed.
```sh
mysql --version
```
4. Check the status of mysql server.
```sh
sudo service mysql status
```

if status is not `running`, then restart the server deamon.
```sh
sudo service mysql restart
```
5. Open mysql
```sh
sudo mysql
```

In the sql prompt type the following to set the root password.
```sh
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD';
```

And then `EXIT` the sql prompt.

6. Then run the security script.

```sh
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
Then use these answers or if already know the answer just fill em up.

```
Securing the MySQL server deployment.

Connecting to MySQL using a blank password.

VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords and improve security. It checks the strength of password and allows the users to set only those passwords which are secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: n

Please set the password for root here.

New password: root

Re-enter new passw: root

By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for them. This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother. You should remove them before moving into a production environment.

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y

Success.

Note: Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from ’localhost’. This ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : n

… skipping.

By default, MySQL comes with a database named ’test’ that anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : n

… skipping.

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y

Success.

All done!
```

7. For sanity check, re run the sql server.

```sh
sudo service mysql restart
```

8. In your python file just mention the root password of the sql server and run the file.

9. You can login to sql server using this command and putting first the sudo password and then the sql root password.

```sh
sudo mysql -u root -p
```
